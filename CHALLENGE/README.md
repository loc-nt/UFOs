## CHALLENGE:

The project is to create a page listing all UFO sightings in the database, with live filters based on end user inputs. The page is built in a professional look, and expect to provide user-friendly experience for everyone.

The projects used some technologies for the ending delivery, including Javascript (for running the filtered table), HTML (for designing and building the page), and CSS code (for styling the page). When it was first loaded, the page will list all of the sightings ever recorded in the database. You should be able to see 5 filters boxes to view UFO sightings based on date, locations, and shapes. As you give some inputs, the table is dynamic and will keep updating based on the your inputs in real time.

Besides all the current features, there are many rooms for further development in the future. First, it should allows uppercase data inputs in the filter boxes. Currently all the inputs must be in lowercase, else the table will return nothing. This might be confusing for some users, and will return inaccurate data. Secondly, in addition to the list of sightings, it would be great if the filters return some more visualization (such as count number of sightings, charts on sightings grouped by country, year, shape and/or duration, etc.). Finally, we can improve the date filter to be a date range, instead of just one date selection.
